> Self-hosted, open-source platform for running Crawlee and Apify Actors on your own infrastructure

## About

Crawlee Cloud is a developer-friendly platform for deploying and managing web scrapers. It provides complete infrastructure for running Crawlee-based scrapers (Playwright, Puppeteer, Cheerio) with an Apify-compatible API, allowing existing Apify SDK code to work without modifications.

## Full Documentation (Context for LLMs)

For a complete overview of the platform, including CLI usage, API reference, and deployment guide, please read the full context file:
