# Apify SDK Compatibility

Crawlee Cloud is fully compatible with the official [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js). Your existing Actors work without code changes.

## Configuration

Set these environment variables to point the SDK to your server:

```bash
export APIFY_API_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com/v2
export APIFY_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

That's it. Your Actor code works unchanged:

```typescript
import { Actor } from 'apify';

await Actor.init();

// All SDK methods work with Crawlee Cloud
await Actor.pushData({ title: 'Example' });
const input = await Actor.getInput();
await Actor.setValue('OUTPUT', results);

await Actor.exit();
```
