# Compare Crawlee Cloud

Crawlee Cloud gives you the power of managed scraping platforms — on your own infrastructure.

## Why Self-Host?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Data Sovereignty** | Your scraped data never leaves your servers |
| **Cost Control** | Flat VPS cost instead of pay-per-request |
| **No Vendor Lock-in** | Open source, MIT licensed |
| **API Compatible** | Works with existing Apify SDK code |
